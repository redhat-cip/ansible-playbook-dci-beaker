# Beaker installation

This is a playbook to install an all-in-one beaker server & lab controller.
It has been designed to be used with [Distributed-CI](https://doc.distributed-ci.io/) but it can also be used independently of it.

## Download

You can download the role from Github with the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/redhat-cip/ansible-playbook-dci-beaker/
    cd ansible-playbook-dci-beaker

## Download the dependencies

    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p roles/

## Initial configuration

Before applying the role, the following files need some configuration:

- `inventory`: adjust the hostname and user of the machine to use as a beaker server

## Deployment

Call Ansible with the following command:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

---
:warning: For Ansible â‰¤ 2.5.6 users, you will face a problem with the `service_facts` module. The solution is to skip the firewall tag:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml --skip-tags=firewall
---

## Post-Deployment

After running the playbook the first time, the credentials for services on the beaker server will be stored in the `credentials/` folder, unless the variables ared hardcoded in `group_vars/all`

## Note about Virtual machines

Virtual machines can use the "virsh" power type. As the virtualization support in Beaker is based on libvirt tools, you might need to install additional packages (like libvirt-client).
For more information, please refer to Beaker Project official [documentation](https://beaker-project.org/docs/).

It is also possible to configure a virtual BMC to manage virtual machines using the IPMI protocol.
For more information, please refer to Virtual BMC official [documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/environments/virtualbmc.html).
